# Aria
Aria is the first moderation-oriented bot I made with my own
framework, and I think I did a pretty good job.

Her features include
* Global bans (to prevent the worst of the worst
from joining your server)
* Mod logs
* Welcome messages
* Temporary voice channels

### FAQ
* **Q:** Why did Aria leave my server?<br>
**A:** This can happen for 3 reasons:
  * If your server is too small (<5 people), she will leave, as there's not really a need for her there.
  * If your server's bot-to-human ratio is too high, she will leave, due to the fact that I still have to
  pay my server's power bill and sitting around, idling, in a bot testing server is wasteful.
  * If you don't grant Aria administrator privileges within 2 minutes of adding her, she will leave.
  This is due to the fact that Aria is a moderation bot, which makes her quite useless without admin permissions.

### Name origin
Some of you might wonder why I picked this name, and won't
even understand who or what the avatar is. Basically, the long
and short of it is that [Aria](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Aria_T'Loak)
is an [asari](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Asari) who controls
a mining asteroid known as Omega. To quote the wiki, "Aria is very authoritative of her reign on Omega, ruling the
station with an iron fist. *[...]* Almost nothing that happens on Omega escapes her notice, causing mercenary groups
to think twice before crossing her."

Due to my love of the Mass Effect series and its story, I felt that this was the perfect name for my moderation bot.
