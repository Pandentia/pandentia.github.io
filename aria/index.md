# Aria
Aria is the first moderation-oriented bot I made with my own framework, and I think I did a pretty good job.

## FAQ
* **Q:** Why did Aria leave my server?<br>
  **A:** This can happen for 3 reasons:
    * If your server is too small (<5 people), she will leave, as there's not really a need for her there.
    * If your server's bot-to-human ratio is too high, she will leave, due to the fact that I still have to
      pay my server's power bill and sitting around, idling, in a bot testing server is wasteful.

## Name origin
Some of you might wonder why I picked this name, and won't
even understand who or what the avatar is. Basically, the long
and short of it is that <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Aria_T'Loak" target="_blank">Aria</a>
is an <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Asari" target="_blank">asari</a> who controls
a mining asteroid known as Omega. To quote the wiki,
> Aria is very authoritative of her reign on Omega, ruling the
station with an iron fist. *[...]* Almost nothing that happens on Omega escapes her notice, causing mercenary groups
to think twice before crossing her.

Due to my love of the Mass Effect series and its story, I felt that this was the perfect name for my moderation bot.
