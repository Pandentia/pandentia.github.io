# About me
Hi! I'm Pandentia. I spend my spare time writing code,
among other things like playing fun little videogames like
N++ or being heavily addicted to Mass Effect (and if you
mention the word [Andromeda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckGMP5OxnLg)
in front of me I will probably unfriend and block you
for all eternity).

## Projects
##### *These are some projects that I built*
* [Liara](https://github.com/Thessia/Liara), 
my prized possession and amazing Discord bot framework
  * [Aria](aria), my amazing moderation bot built with this
  framework
